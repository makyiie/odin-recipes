<h3>Description</h3>
<div class="section">
<p>The secret to this 4 ingredient lemon pound cake is sweetened condensed milk. Dense but moist, it makes a great base for strawberry shortcake. When served by itself, I top it with a simple lemon juice and powdered sugar glaze.</p>
</div>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<div class="section">
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons lemon zest (optional)</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups self-rising flour</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<div class="section">
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with nonstick spray, line bottom and sides with parchment paper, and spray again with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, sweetened condensed milk, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a bowl. Add flour and mix just until flour is moistened. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 55 to 65 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack before removing from the pan.</li>
    </ol>
